                    When it comes to staying warm below freezing temperatures, layering is key. The base layer of clothing consists of a tight fitting and relatively thin shirt to remove moister from the skin. It's generally made of smart wool or synthetic materials which dry quickly, but they easily become odorous. The second layer is for isolation, and is therefore generally long-sleeved and thick. Layer three is meant for protection against the elements. It should be waterproof and breathable. The fourth - and final - layer is an isolating pouffy for the cold.

                    Some friends and I recently road-tripped to Gatineau Park in Québec for a 'survival camping' adventure. We arrived late at night and soon thereafter hiked roughly 3 hours up the snowy mountain along a path under a stunning starry night sky. Once at the top, we built an emergency shelter with a tarp and rope, collected wood and got a fire going. The following day, we collected water from a frozen lake and improved our shelter by wind-proofing the sides and strengthening the roof, as well as organizing the firewood. The Sunday morning greeted us with a beautiful layer of freshly fallen snow.
